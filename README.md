## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me get more experience with handling API calls in React. I also implemented a light and dark mode for the first time as well. Overall this project is another step to learning how to style webpages as well.

### Continued development
One thing I wish to look into is implementing the prefered theme depending on user computer preference.

### Useful resources

- [React The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) - This has been my main source for learning some nuances of react.
- [Kevin Powell YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - Kevin Powell's YouTube page has been a tremendous help for me as a CSS resource.
